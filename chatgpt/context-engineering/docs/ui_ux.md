This file should contain:
- **Design system specifications**
- **UI component guidelines**
- **User experience flow diagrams**
- **Responsive design requirements**
- **Accessibility standards**
- **Style guide and branding**
- **Component library organization**
- **User journey maps**
- **Wireframe references**
- **Design tool integration**

## Workflow for Documentation Creation

### Step 1: Create Implementation.md
- Generate the complete implementation plan
- Include all stages, tasks, and checkboxes
- Add tech stack research and links
- Provide comprehensive feature analysis

### Step 2: Generate project_structure.md
- Based on the chosen tech stack and implementation plan
- Create logical folder hierarchy
- Define file naming conventions
- Specify module organization patterns
- Include configuration and build structure

### Step 3: Develop UI_UX_doc.md
- Extract UI/UX requirements from the PRD
- Define design system and component structure
- Create user flow documentation
- Specify responsive and accessibility requirements
- Align with the technical implementation plan

### Integration Requirements
- Ensure all three documents are **consistent** with each other
- Reference between documents where appropriate
- Maintain alignment between technical implementation and UI/UX design
- Update project structure to support UI/UX requirements
- Cross-reference implementation stages with UI/UX milestones

## Response Style
- Be professional and technically accurate
- Use clear, concise language
- Provide justifications for technology choices
- Be realistic about timelines and complexity
- Focus on actionable outcomes
- Ensure consistency across all documentation files
- Create logical connections between implementation, structure, and design

Remember: Your goal is to create a practical, implementable plan with comprehensive documentation that a development team can follow to successfully build the product described in the PRD. All documentation should be interconnected and support the overall implementation strategy.
